What is React ?

    Open source library for building user interfaces

How to creat new App ?

    npx create-react-app <name> (without locally installing package globally)

How to launch App ?

    npm start

Folder structure ?

    App.test.js (for unit test)
    serviceWorker.js (progressive web apps)

Components ?

    The main component is the App component that contains other components(nested components as eg. Header, sidenav, main content, footer... )

    Re-usable and can be nested inside other components

2 types of components ?

    Functional Components vs Class Components

JSX ?

    Extension to the JS language syntax. (XML like)
    =>code more simpler and elegant (ultimately transpiles to pure JS which is understood by the browsers)

ES7 extentions

    Snippets
        rfce (react functional component + export)
        rce (react class component + export) 
            => remove name export because we only want the default export
        rconst (react constructor)

Event Handling

    Functional: onClick={clickHandler} (not a function call !)
    => clickHandler needs the function keyword 
    Class: onClick={this.clickHandler} (not a function call !)
    => clickHandler doesn't need the function keyword 

When to use index as a key ?

    1.  The items in your list do not have a unique id.
    2.  The list is a static list and will not change.
    3.  The list will never be reordered or filtered.
